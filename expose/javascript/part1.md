Question 1: 20
Question 2: 20
Question 3: 20
Question 4: "ReferenceError: result is not defined" because it exists outside the blocks allowed for the let keyword.
Question 5: "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable" because constant variables are not able to be reassigned.
Question 6: Same error as question 5. Important to also note that Const variables are not able to be accessed outside of the scope it is so this was not able to be returned regardless.
